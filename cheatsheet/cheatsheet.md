| GIT BASICS |
| git init directory | Create empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no arguments to initialize the current directory as a git repository. |
| git clone repo | Clone repo located at repo onto local machine. Original repo can be located on the local filesystem or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH. |
| git config user.name name | Define author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs commonly use --global flag to set config options for current user. |
| git add directory | Stage all changes in directory for the next commit. Replace directory with a file to change a specific file. |
| git commit -m "message" | Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor, use <message> as the commit message. |
| git status | List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked. |
| git log | Display the entire commit history using the default format. For customization see additional options. |
| git diff | Show unstaged changes between your index and working directory. |
| UNDOING CHANGES |
| git revert commit | Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in commit, then apply it to the current branch.|
| git reset file | Remove file from the staging area, but leave the working directory unchanged. This unstages a file without overwriting any changes. |
| git clean -n | Shows which files would be removed from working directory. Use the -f flag in place of the -n flag to execute the clean. |
| REMOTE REPOSITORIES |
| git remote add name url | Create a new connection to a remote repo. After adding a remote, you can use name as a shortcut for <url> in other commands. |
| git fetch remote branch | Fetches a specific branch, from the repo. Leave off branch to fetch all remote refs. |
| git pull remote | Fetch the specified remote’s copy of current branch and immediately merge it into the local copy. |
| git push remote branch | Push the branch to remote, along with necessary commits and objects. Creates named branch in the remote repo if it doesn’t exist. |

## Vagrant commando's

| vagrant box add | allows you to install a box (or VM) to the local machine. |
| vagrant box remove | removes a box from the local machine. |
| vagrant box list | lists the locally installed Vagrant boxes. |
| vagrant init | initializes a project to use Vagrant. |
| vagrant up |This command is used to create and configure your guest environment/machines based on your Vagrantfile. |
| vagrant status | This command is used to check the status of the Vagrant managed machines. | 
| vagrant reload | This command is used to do a complete reload on the Vagrantfile. Use this command anytime you make a change to the Vagrantfile. This command will do the same thing as running a halt command and then running an up command directly after. |
| vagrant halt | Executing this is self-explanatory, bring down the environment Vagrant is managing. |
| vagrant suspend | This command suspends the environment instead of shutting it down. Enables a quicker startup of the environment when brought back up later. |
| vagrant resume | Command is used after putting environment in a suspended state. |
| vagrant destroy | Beware. This command will bring down the environment if running and then destroys all of the resources that were created along with the initial creation. |
| vagrant package | This command is used to package a running virtualbox environment in a re-usable box. |
| vagrant ssh | SSH into you vagrant running machines. |
| vagrant gem | Install Vagrant plugins via RubyGems. |
| vagrant package | Create a distribution of the VM you have running. |
| vagrant <command> –help | Command that will provide man pages for a vagrant command. |
